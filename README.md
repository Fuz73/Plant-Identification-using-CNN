# Plant-Identification-using-CNN
## Building a Plant Recognition Model using CNN and Flask

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**

   - Gathered a dataset of different plant images
   - Resized images to 128 pixels for consistency

2. **Building the CNN Model**

   - Constructed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
   - Set the model's accuracy to around 62%

3. **Exporting the Model**

   - Exported the trained model in .h5 format

4. **Creating a Flask Web Application**

   - Installed Flask library
   - Ran the Flask web application
   - Obtained an authentication token

5. **Running the Flask App**

   - Input the path to the .h5 model in the Flask app
   - Demonstrated the Flask app in action (not live due to time constraints)
   - Showed the app interface where input images can be provided

6. **Testing the Model**

   - Provided an input image to the Flask app
   - Model successfully detected the plant in the image

7. **Conclusion**

   - Demonstrated the process of building a plant recognition model using CNN and Flask
   - Showed the successful detection of a plant in an input image
